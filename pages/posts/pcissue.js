        Rewind to a couple weeks ago.  I am going about my usual morning business, and usual, I switch on my PC and it flicks on for a moment and then immediately flicks back off.  I built this PC from parts.  I thought, ok this is a power supply that is going bad.

      So I get a power supply and plug everything up.  Same issue.

      So I get a new motherboard and CPU.  Get everything plugged up, apply thermal paste, CPU fan, drives, RAM, etc... You know, everything back together and it powers up to the BIOS.  I mess around with BIOS settings.  I had to change the drive modes around, and I get the OS to boot up.  But same issue happens.  Power on for just a split second and clicks off and nothing I do seems to work.  I unplug the power cable and plug back in and click click.  Leave it for a while, come back, flick the power rocker on the power supply back on, plug power cable in, hit power button and click click.
      </p>
      <p>
      So I get a new case.  What else can it be????
