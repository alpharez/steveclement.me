      PC still shut itself off with a *thunk*!  No power at all and does not want to start back up.  I can get it to turn on and immediately it shuts off.  Parts that I replaced so far: Motherboard, CPU, Case.  Parts that I re-used: 650W Power Supply, RAM, SDD Drives, AMD Radeon 5700 Video Card.

      My theory is it is the video card, or the video card needs more power.  I do not believe it is the RAM because I have swapped those already with no luck.  So it has to be the video card.  I didn't want it to be the video card because supply chain issues have made these very expensive.

      To be continued...  case is good... video card?  video card needs more power?
