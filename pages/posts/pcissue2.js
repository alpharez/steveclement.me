        My PC was going fine for awhile.  I received the new case since I suspected the old case had a short in it, causing the thing to randomly shut off or fail to turn on.  Today around 2pm, the PC powers completely off with no warning.  So, I decided it's time to go ahead and switch everything to the new case.

        I had no issues and got everything plugged in and squared away.  So far there has been no issues.  If I still have the power problem, then I guess the next thing to replace is the RAM.

      To be continued...  but hoping not, and it is a case short that was the problem.
